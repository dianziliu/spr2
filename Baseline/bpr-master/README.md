Bayesian Personalized Ranking is a learning algorithm for collaborative filtering
first introduced in:
BPR: Bayesian Personalized Ranking from Implicit Feedback. Steffen Rendle, Christoph
Freudenthaler, Zeno Gantner and Lars Schmidt-Thieme, Proc. UAI 2009.

This is a simple Python implementation of BPR for matrix factorization based on the
C# one provided by the original authors in MyMediaLite, see http://www.mymedialite.net.
I've also implemented a BPR version of
SLIM: Sparse Linear Methods for Top-N Recommender Systems.  Xia Ning and George Karypis, Proc. ACM RecSys 2012.
